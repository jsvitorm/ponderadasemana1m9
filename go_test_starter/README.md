This repository contains the following:

1. [starter package](starter.go) containg three functions
2. [starter_test package](starter_test.go) for the related tests

## Background

This is the accompanying code repo for the [Golang testing with TDD article](https://williaminfante.medium.com/golang-testing-with-tdd-e548d8wbe776).

We’ll introduce three kinds of functions in our starter package. The aim of these functions is to introduce go testing concepts:
- `SayHello()` — basics
- `TestPickAnInteger()` — subtests, refactoring, coverage
- `TestCheckHealth()` — use of more advanced testing libraries


## Usage

This requires a minimum version of Go 1.16 and testify 1.7.0.

You can also just execute:
```
go mod tidy
```

To run tests and optionally add `-v` for verbose:
```
go test -v
```

To add coverage to the desired output like `coverage.out`, simply:
```
go test -v -coverprofile coverage.out
```

To create an html-formatted coverage document:
```
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html
```
